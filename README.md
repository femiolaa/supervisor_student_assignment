## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `openpyxl`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

# Files
- `assign_supervisors.py:` The main Python script that performs the assignment.
- `SIWES 2025.xlsx:` An Excel file containing the list of students (first column should have student names).
- `SIWES SUPERVISORS.xlsx:` An Excel file containing the list of supervisors (first column should have supervisor names).
- `Student_Supervisor_Assignment.xlsx:` The output Excel file generated by the script with assigned supervisors.

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supervisor-student-assignment.git
cd supervisor-student-assignment
```
- Ensure your Excel files `(SIWES 2025.xlsx and SIWES SUPERVISORS.xlsx)` are in the same directory as the script.

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python assign_supervisors.py
```

After running the script, a new file named `Student_Supervisor_Assignment.xlsx` will be created in the same directory, containing the assignments.


# How It Works
The script reads the student and supervisor names from the provided Excel files.
It assigns supervisors to students in a round-robin manner, ensuring that the rows are maintained.
The results are saved to a new Excel file.
